SQL Practice Exercises Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of SQL practice exercises designed for learners and professionals who want to strengthen their database querying skills. It covers a wide spectrum of SQL concepts, ranging from basic queries to advanced topics, making it suitable for both beginners and those preparing for interviews in data-related roles.

The exercises are based on a sample employee attendance dataset that includes columns such as emp_id, emp_name, department, hire_date, attendance_date, login_time, and logout_time. This dataset allows users to simulate real-world scenarios and apply SQL concepts in practical situations.

Topics Covered:

Basic Queries: Learn to retrieve data using SELECT, filter with WHERE, sort with ORDER BY, and aggregate data using GROUP BY and HAVING.

Joins: Practice combining data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN to understand relational database concepts.

Subqueries: Explore single-row, multi-row, and correlated subqueries to solve complex querying problems.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Learn both recursive and non-recursive CTEs to break down complex queries into manageable parts.

Date & Time Functions: Use functions like DATE_FORMAT, TIMESTAMPDIFF, LAST_DAY, DAYNAME, TIME_TO_SEC, and SEC_TO_TIME to handle real-world date and time calculations.

Aggregations and Calculations: Compute totals, averages, maximums, minimums, and custom calculations such as working hours in decimal or formatted time.

Advanced Concepts: Practice conditional logic with IF() statements, window functions, derived tables, and other intermediate-to-advanced SQL techniques.

Purpose:

Build a strong foundation in SQL querying

Solve practical business and data analysis problems

Prepare effectively for data analyst, business analyst, and database interview questions
